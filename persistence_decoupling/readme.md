#Domain / Persistence separation

##Goals

* business objects should not know about persistence
* persistence should be plugged into the business rules
  * allowing for different implementations
  * this should be configurable

##Solutions

each file contains some of the ides on the subject,
containing domain and persistence classes as well as a small test
